    "\n",
    "### 3.2) Churning  — true migration\n",
    "Caused by resonant interactions with spiral arms or the Galactic bar. The star changes its angular momentum. Its orbit remains nearly circular, but at a different radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogy:\n",
    "A person changes their place of residence but continues to live a stable, orderly life.\n",
