        "This study investigates where in the Milky Way stars and their exoplanets originally formed by reconstructing stellar birth radii using ages, metallicities, and kinematic data. It finds that planet-hosting stars—especially those with high-mass planets—are typically younger, more metal-rich, and formed closer to the Galactic center than stars without detected planets. Planet formation efficiency decreases with galactocentric distance, a trend that is stronger for high-mass planets. \n",

        "More than 5,500 exoplanets have been discovered, showing that planet formation is widespread and closely linked to the properties of host stars, particularly their metallicity. Observations and theory indicate that metal-rich stars are more likely to host giant planets, reflecting the role of Galactic chemical evolution in shaping planetary systems. Because stellar metallicity varies with time and galactocentric distance—and stars migrate from their birthplaces—their present locations do not reflect their formation environments. By combining stellar ages and metallicities to reconstruct Galactic birth radii, this work aims to reveal how exoplanet formation and evolution depend on where and when stars formed in the Milky Way.\n",
