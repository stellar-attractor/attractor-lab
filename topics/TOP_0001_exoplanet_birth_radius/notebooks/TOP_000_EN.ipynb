On average, planets — especially massive ones — form more efficiently closer to the Galactic center. However, stars migrate, and as a result we observe planetary systems far from their original birthplaces. To reconstruct a true map of where worlds are born, one must introduce the birth radius (r₍birth₎) and account for stellar migration — precisely the framework that links exoplanets to the chemical history of the Galaxy in both studies."
