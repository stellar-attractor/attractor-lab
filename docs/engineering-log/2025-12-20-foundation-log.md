## Attractor Lab: Foundation Day

This document captures the architectural and organizational decisions
made during the initial setup of Attractor Lab.

### Key outcomes
- Repository identity and scope finalized.
- GitHub organization-level workflow established.
- Core Python package (`lulab`) introduced.
- Separation between science (topics), formats, and tooling defined.

### Rationale
The project is designed to scale across many scientific topics while
maintaining a single source of truth for data, code, and narrative assets.

### Notes
This log intentionally focuses on decisions and structure, not implementation details.
