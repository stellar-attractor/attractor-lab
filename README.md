# Attractor Lab

Science → Data → Code → Visuals → Narrative.

Attractor Lab is an open, reproducible workspace for turning publicly available
scientific literature and datasets into:
- reusable analysis/visualization code,
- figures and tables,
- scripts and educational texts,
- LaTeX/PDF deliverables for outreach content.

## What this is
- A structured repository for scientific exploration + media production.
- A bridge between published research and understandable storytelling.

## What this is NOT
- Not original scientific research.
- Not a source of new scientific claims.

See `DISCLAIMER.md`.

## Repository structure (high-level)
- `core/` — reusable Python + LaTeX core (shared styles, utilities)
- `topics/` — source-of-truth topic packs (data, analysis, figures, tables)
- `formats/` — deliverables (episodes, lectures, posts) that reference topics
- `tools/` — project generators and build helpers
- `registry/` — indices and metadata for navigation at scale
